This page serves to demonstrate my competencies in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, ReactJS, Bootstrap, general logic building, and more. The page was built and deployed as a React app.


This page uses HTML,CSS, and JSX inserted into compartmentalized ReactJS components to build the page. 


In my Boggle section, I rely extensive on React hooks and state to update the components of the game in real time without refreshing the page. As of 5/7, there are some QoL adjustments to the game I need to make, but at a basic level it functions. Next, I intend to improve the efficacy of the code by finding ways to trim as many unnecessary lines as possible. In the coming months and with training in databases, I would also like to be able to save previous scores or keep a high-score board of some kind that stays on the site.


In my About section, I taught myself responsive design that works at most viewpoints. This involved media breakpoints and using responsive column design with Bootstrap.


In my API section, I use the OpenWeather API to display weather data from different cities. I also use the native JavaScript geolocation function to pull weather data from the users currently location.
